<h1 align="center">> My / dotfiles <</h1>

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! Here you’ll find my carefully curated configurations and scripts for a sleek Debian/sid environment. Feel free to explore, adapt, and integrate these dotfiles into your own setup. Instead of mirroring my entire configuration, I recommend cherry-picking the components that best suit your workflow.

In the near future, I plan to streamline the setup process with an installation script. For now, you’ll need to piece together the components yourself, but I hope you find the individual pieces useful in creating a setup that’s uniquely yours.
